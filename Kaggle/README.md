# AI4ED Kaggle-Google Competition Teams

Teams should self organize with at least one current student and one recent graduate.  Teams can be as large as the competition allows.  We will have a weekly 30 minute Zoom meeting for progress on Saturdays at 5 PM EST that will be recoreded for those who can make it. At least one team member should be present.

Here is a list of every Saturday from the start date until the competition ends:

1. February 24, 2024 - Organize teams. Understand the competition.
2. March 2, 2024
3. March 9, 2024 - Spring Break

## Gemma Competition

[Google – AI Assistants for Data Tasks with Gemma](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-assistants-with-gemma/) 

Google recently launched Gemma, a new family of open LLMs built from the same research and technology used to create their Gemini models. In this competition, you’re challenged to demonstrate how to use Gemma to accomplish one or more data science oriented tasks.


## Description

Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention and imagination.

Often referred to as "foundation models", much of their potential lies in their ability to be adapted to accomplish specialized tasks for a seemingly unlimited number of use cases. As the technology rapidly develops, there’s a massive opportunity to uncover the best methods and approaches for adapting LLMs to new and specialized use cases.

The goal of this competition is to create a notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma LLM to accomplish one of the following data science oriented tasks:

- Explain or teach basic data science concepts.
- Answer common questions about the Python programming language.
- Summarize Kaggle solution write-ups.
- Explain or teach concepts from Kaggle competition solution write-ups.
- Answer common questions about the Kaggle platform.

By participating in this competition, you'll both be building a useful tool and contributing to the ML field's collective knowledge of how to best sharpen LLMs for real-world needs.

## Evaluation

### Eligibility Criteria

- **Compliant**: The submission was consistent with the guidelines and instructions. `[yes/no]`
- **Topical**: The submission was relevant to one of the 5x topics. `[yes/no]`
- **Open**: The notebook and all of the underlying data sources were made public. `[yes/no]`

### Evaluation Rubric

- **Technical**: The approach made efficient use of strategies such as few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, and/or fine-tuning. `[0-10pts]`
- **Descriptive**: The code was well-documented, with markdown cells that both explained the code and provided context. `[0-10pts]`
- **Useful**: The approach produces outputs that are helpful or high quality. `[0-10pts]`
- **Robust**: The approach works well when tested with additional inputs. `[0-10pts]`

## Timeline

- **February 21, 2024** - Start Date.
- **April 14, 2024** - Entry Deadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to compete.
- **April 14, 2024** - Team Merger Deadline. This is the last day participants may join or merge teams.
- **April 14, 2024** - Final Submission Deadline.

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

## Submission Instructions

To participate in this competition, you must create and share a public Kaggle Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma model to accomplish one of the 5x relevant tasks. Your Kaggle Notebook must be made public (along with any underlying data sources) and it should be attached to the official competition dataset. All team members must be listed as collaborators on the notebook, and the notebook must be submitted via the Google Form. All submissions will be assessed initially according to the eligibility criteria, and all eligible submissions will be scored according to the evaluation rubric. We will grade the most recent submission from your team (per competition, not per category).

To submit to this competition fill out the Google Form [here](https://example.com/form).

**General Tips:**

- Follow the guidelines as closely as possible and avoid working outside of the guidelines.
- Make it obvious what you did, why you did it, and what category you are submitting to.
- Make it as easy as possible for the graders to understand what you are doing.
- Make it as easy as possible for the graders to understand why you did a good job.
- Review this Twitter thread for additional tips and advice.

## Prizes

There are 5x $10,000 USD prizes in total, with one prize per category. Each prize will be awarded to the most helpful tutorial notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma model to accomplish one of the 5x relevant tasks.

In addition to the monetary prizes, we will also give away special Kaggle swag to recognize:

- 5x public notebooks that get published in the first 5 weeks, and
- 25 Kagglers that upload well-documented Gemma model variations to Kaggle Models (and then make use of it within their submissions)
