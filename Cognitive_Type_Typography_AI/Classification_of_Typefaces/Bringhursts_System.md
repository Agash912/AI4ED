# Bringhurst's System

Robert Bringhurst's system for classifying typefaces, detailed in his seminal work "The Elements of Typographic Style," proposes a more nuanced and historical approach compared to many classification systems like Panose-1. Bringhurst's system is deeply rooted in the history of typography and the evolution of typeface design, reflecting a blend of technical, cultural, and aesthetic considerations. Unlike systems that categorize typefaces based on specific physical characteristics alone, Bringhurst's method also considers the historical and stylistic lineage of typefaces.

While Bringhurst does not lay out a simple, numbered classification system akin to DIN 16518 or the Vox-ATypI classification, his approach can be summarized by identifying key historical and stylistic periods of type design, each with its defining characteristics. Here’s an overview inspired by the principles found in "The Elements of Typographic Style," tailored to resemble the structure requested:

1. **Humanist or Old Style**: Reflects the influence of early Italian Renaissance letterforms, characterized by moderate contrast between thick and thin strokes, a diagonal stress, and bracketed serifs. This style mimics the look of pen-drawn letters.

2. **Transitional**: Marks the evolution from Old Style to Modern typefaces, with greater contrast between thick and thin strokes, more vertical stress, and less pronounced bracketing on the serifs. This style bridges the gap with a balance between old and new.

3. **Neoclassical & Didone**: Known for extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, vertical axis, and fine, unbracketed serifs. These typefaces emerged in the late 18th century, showcasing elegance and precision.

4. **Slab Serif**: Features robust, block-like serifs and minimal contrast between strokes. Originating in the 19th century, this style varies from geometric to more humanist approaches.

5. **Sans Serif**: Encompasses a broad category from Grotesque to Geometric, Humanist, and Neo-grotesque sans serif designs. These typefaces are defined by the absence of serifs and have various letter shapes based on geometric simplicity or more organic, humanist forms.

6. **Script**: Includes typefaces that resemble handwritten text, from formal, elegant scripts to casual, informal styles. These fonts mimic the fluidity and variance of handwriting.

7. **Blackletter**: Characterized by dense, intricate letterforms that harken back to medieval manuscript calligraphy. This style is distinguished by its textured, ornate appearance.

8. **Decorative and Display**: A broad category that encompasses a variety of typefaces designed for specific uses, effects, or to capture attention. These fonts often prioritize aesthetic expression over readability.

9. **Non-Latin Scripts**: Acknowledges the vast diversity of type design beyond the Latin alphabet, covering scripts from around the world, each with its own historical and cultural significance.

Bringhurst’s system is deeply informative, providing insight into the evolution of typeface design and encouraging typographers to consider the historical context and intended use of typefaces in their work. This approach helps designers make more informed choices that enhance the readability, beauty, and function of printed and digital texts.
