## IBM's Classification of Fonts

IBM's Classification of Fonts, utilized in the OS/2 table of TrueType fonts, divides typefaces into 10 classes, each with specific subclasses to further categorize fonts based on characteristics and historical context. This system includes:

- Class 0: No Classification
- Class 1: Old-Style Serifs, subdivided into subclasses for various styles like IBM rounded legibility, garalde, Venetian, and more.
- Class 2: Transitional Serifs, identifying typefaces that bridge old-style and modern serif designs.
- Class 3: Modern Serifs, focusing on the "modernity" of didones.
- Class 4: Clarendon Serifs, for industrial typefaces with pronounced serifs.
- Class 5: Slab Serifs, highlighting mechanistic typefaces.
- Class 7: Free-Form Serifs, a unique category for fonts like Souvenir.
- Class 8: Sans Serif, with subclasses for different styles including IBM neo-grotesque gothic and humanist.
- Class 9: Ornamentals, covering gothic, engraved, and shadowed typefaces.
- Class 10: Scripts, not distinguishing between manual and script typefaces, and including subclasses for uncial, brush joined, formal joined, and more.

Each class and subclass provides a framework to classify fonts by their visual characteristics, historical origins, and stylistic features.
