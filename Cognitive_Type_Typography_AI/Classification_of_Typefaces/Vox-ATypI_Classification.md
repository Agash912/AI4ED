# Vox-ATypI Classification

The ATypI Classification, also known as the Vox-ATypI classification, is a system used to categorize typefaces based on their characteristics and historical influences. Originally devised by French typographer Maximilien Vox in 1954, it was later adopted and expanded by the Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI). This system classifies typefaces into 11 main categories, each reflecting distinct stylistic and historical attributes. These categories provide a framework for understanding the evolution of typeface design and for identifying the visual and structural characteristics of different fonts. Here's a detailed look at each category within the Vox-ATypI classification:

- Humanist: Inspired by the handwriting of Italian Renaissance scribes, Humanist typefaces are characterized by a strong calligraphic influence, evident in their varied stroke weights and serifs that resemble pen strokes. This category includes the earliest Roman typefaces, such as those designed by Nicolas Jenson.

- Garalde: Named after Aldus Manutius' punchcutter Francesco Griffo (Garalde is a portmanteau of Garamond and Aldine). These typefaces, from the 16th century, show an evolution from Humanist designs, with more contrast between thick and thin strokes, and more uniform serifs.

- Transitional: Marking the transition between Garalde and Didone typefaces, these fonts, epitomized by John Baskerville's work in the 18th century, feature greater contrast between thick and thin lines, sharper serifs, and a more vertical axis.

- Didone: Characterized by strong contrast between thick and thin lines, narrow and unbracketed serifs, and a vertical stress in the letters, Didone typefaces emerged in the late 18th century. They are associated with designers like Firmin Didot and Giambattista Bodoni.

- Slab Serif: Also known as Egyptian, these typefaces, which originated in the early 19th century, feature thick, block-like serifs. They were designed for advertising and display purposes and include variations with rounded edges and more refined proportions.

- Sans Serif: This class includes typefaces without serifs, characterized by clean, simple lines. They can be further divided into subcategories such as Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist, each with distinct characteristics.

- Script: Mimicking handwriting, Script typefaces range from formal styles, based on seventeenth and eighteenth-century writing masters, to more casual, contemporary designs. They often feature connecting letters.

- Graphic: A broad category that encompasses decorative fonts and those designed for specific purposes or effects, not fitting into the traditional classifications. These can include display, novelty, and artistic fonts.

- Blackletter: Also known as Gothic or Fraktur, these typefaces are based on medieval script and characterized by their dense, dark appearance and ornate detail. They were commonly used in Europe before the Renaissance.

- Glyphic: Encompassing typefaces that mimic inscriptions or engraving, Glyphic fonts often have flared or tapered strokes and may include serifs that are integrated into the letterform rather than added as separate elements.

- Non-Latin: This category acknowledges the vast world of typefaces designed for scripts other than Latin, recognizing the global diversity of typography. It includes fonts for scripts such as Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Indic, East Asian, and more.

The Vox-ATypI classification provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the vast landscape of typeface design, reflecting both the evolution of typographic style and the broad diversity of letterforms. By categorizing fonts into these classes, the system helps designers, typographers, and enthusiasts to appreciate the nuances of typeface selection and application.
