# The British Standards Classification of Typefaces (BS 2961)

The British Standards Classification of Typefaces (BS 2961) is a system developed in the United Kingdom for classifying typefaces systematically. Unlike the more general and stylistic approaches such as the ATypI (Vox-ATypI) classification, the BS 2961 standard provides a structured method, focusing on specific attributes of typefaces to categorize them. While it shares the goal of classifying typefaces to facilitate understanding and selection, the specifics of the BS 2961 system are distinct and tailored to align with British standards for typography.

However, as of my last update, detailed, attribute-by-attribute breakdowns similar to the Panose-1 system for BS 2961 specifically were not widely documented or disseminated in public resources. The British Standards Classification system was designed to cover various aspects of typography and printing practices, but the detailed attributes it uses for classifying typefaces—such as serif style, weight, proportion, and others—are not as publicly and precisely outlined as in the Panose-1 system.

The BS 2961 system would likely categorize typefaces based on several key attributes, potentially including:

1. **Typeface Family**: Similar to Panose-1's Family Kind, classifying typefaces into broad categories based on their general appearance and purpose (e.g., serif, sans-serif, script).

2. **Serif Style**: Identifying the style of serifs if present, which could range from traditional to contemporary, and including specific shapes and forms.

3. **Weight**: The visual heaviness of the typeface, from light to bold or black, affecting readability and emphasis in text.

4. **Width/Proportion**: The relative width of characters, which could influence text density and aesthetic appeal.

5. **X-Height**: The height of lowercase letters relative to capital letters, affecting readability and overall visual balance.

6. **Contrast**: The degree of variation between thick and thin strokes within characters, a feature that can dramatically affect the typeface's character.

While this structure would logically align with the principles of type classification, the specific implementation of these or other attributes in BS 2961 is less commonly discussed in widely accessible typographic literature or resources. The system was intended for use within the UK's printing and design industries to standardize typeface classification, which could include more technical specifications and standards relevant to those fields.

For precise details on how the BS 2961 classification system is structured and the specific attributes it employs, one would typically refer to the official documentation provided by the British Standards Institution (BSI). This documentation would offer the authoritative guide on how typefaces are classified under this system, including any updates or revisions to the classification criteria over time.
