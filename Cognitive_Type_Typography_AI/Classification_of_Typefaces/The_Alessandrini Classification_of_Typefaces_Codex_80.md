# The Alessandrini Classification of Typefaces: Codex 80 

The Alessandrini Classification of Typefaces, introduced in Codex 80 by Jean Alessandrini in 1979, offers a detailed and innovative approach to categorizing typefaces, drawing inspiration from the biological classification of species. This classification is distinctive for its comprehensive framework, including 19 preliminary designations, two orthogonal modifiers, and five additional lists of qualifiers, enriched with creative neologisms and a touch of humor. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this classification works:

### Preliminary Designations (Dénominations Préliminaires)
Alessandrini introduces 19 preliminary categories for typefaces, each with unique characteristics:

1. **Simplices**: Refers to sans-serif typefaces, emphasizing that all typefaces consist of lines, thereby critiquing the term "lineal."
2. **Emparectes**: Denotes Egyptian typefaces known for their strictly rectangular serifs, differentiating from Vox's "mechanistic" category.
3. **Emparectes à Congés**: Features Egyptian typefaces with a rounding effect between the downstroke and the serif.
4. **Deltapodes**: Identifies typefaces with delta-shaped (triangular) serifs, a category not anticipated by Vox.
5. **Deltapodes à Congés**: Covers Deltapodes with rounded serifs.
6. **Filextres**: Refers to typefaces with threadlike serifs, a nod to Didones.
7. **Claviennes**: Lumps all varieties of Roman typefaces into one category, based on serifs shaped like nail heads.
8. **Romaines**: Specifically applies to incised typefaces inspired by engraving in marble.
9. **Gestuelles Calligraphiques**: Encompasses scripts based on pen-drawn calligraphic scripts.
10. **Gestuelles Brossées**: Pertains to scripts drawn with a brush, reflecting everyday handwriting rather than formal calligraphy.
11. **Onciales**: Represents scripts inspired by uncial handwriting, including what are commonly known as Celtic scripts.
12. **Germanes**: Refers to Gothic typefaces, acknowledging the cultural stereotype associated with Gothic script in Northern Europe.
13. **Aliennes**: Encompasses all non-Latin scripts, reflecting a Latin-centric view.
14. **Exotypes**: Identifies Latin typefaces that simulate non-Latin scripts, often used in advertising.
15. **Machinales**: Covers typefaces from the 1970s inspired by OCR fonts used in administrative documents.
16. **Ludiques**: Denotes typefaces designed more for amusement than readability.
17. **Hybrides**: Applies to typefaces combining elements from multiple categories.
18. **Transfuges**: Refers to typefaces whose different weights span several categories.

### Orthogonal Modifiers (Éventualités)
Two orthogonal qualifications complement the preliminary designations:

1. **Diagones**: Pertains to italics and slanted typefaces, with variations like mini-diagones, maxi-diagones, and anti-diagones indicating the degree of slope.
2. **Stenciliennes**: Refers to stenciled letters, popular in the 1970s.

### Additional Lists of Qualifiers
Alessandrini further refines classification with five lists of qualifiers:

1. **Objective Formal Considerations**: Includes attributes like light, bold, extended, shadowed, three-dimensional, etc.
2. **Historical Reference Points**: Lists periods like Archaic, Renaissance, Modern, etc.
3. **Aesthetic and Stylistic Considerations**: Features styles like Classical, Baroque, Pop, etc.
4. **Subjective Formal Considerations**: Offers a list that can be extended to include terms like monotone, expressive, dramatic, etc.
5. **Geographic Areas and Original Aspects**: Focuses on the geographical origin of typefaces.

This classification system stands out for its depth, flexibility, and the creative lexicon introduced by Alessandrini. Despite receiving a lukewarm reception from the printing profession, largely due to its departure from tradition and the emphasis on 1970s typefaces, Alessandrini's Codex 80 offers a rich, albeit unconventional, framework for understanding and categorizing the diversity of typefaces beyond the constraints of earlier systems.
