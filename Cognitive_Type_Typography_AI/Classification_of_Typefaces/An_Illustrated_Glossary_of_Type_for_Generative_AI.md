## Typography terms explained with pictures

01. Font/Typeface:
   
The terms "typeface" and "font" are often used interchangeably, but they do have different meanings in the context of typography:

**Typeface**: A typeface refers to the collective design of a set of characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and other glyphs. It's the artistic design which you perceive visually; for instance, 'Times New Roman', 'Arial', and 'Baskerville' are all typefaces. It encompasses the aesthetic and style of the characters that make up the type family.

**Font**: A font, on the other hand, refers to the physical embodiment or digital file of a typeface. In traditional printing, a font would be a specific size, weight, and style of a typeface. For example, '12-point Times New Roman Bold' and '10-point Times New Roman Italic' are different fonts within the Times New Roman typeface family. In digital terms, a font is the file that you install on your computer or use in various software applications to display and print characters.

In essence, a typeface is what you see—the consistent visual appearance or style of the characters—while a font is what you use, a file or a set of metal pieces that delivers the typeface to the page or screen.

02. Character:
An individual symbol of the full character set that makes up a typeface; may take the form of a letter, number, punctuation mark, etc.

03. Alternate Character/Glyph:
A non-standard (sometimes decorative) variation of a character that comes as an extra option with a font file.

04. Serif:
A short line or stroke attached to or extending from the open ends of a letterform; also refers to the general category of typefaces that have been designed with this feature.

05. Sans-Serif/Sans:
Literally "without line"; the general category of typefaces (or an individual typeface) designed without serifs.

06. Italic:
A slanted version of a typeface (slants from left to right); a true italic is uniquely designed, more than a tilted version of the upright (a.k.a. "roman") typeface.

## The Foundation: Positioning & Spacing

07. Baseline:
The imaginary line on which most letters and other characters sit.

08. Cap Line:
The imaginary line that marks the upper boundary of capital letters and some lowercase letters' ascenders (see Ascender definition in the next section).

09. X-Height:
The height of a typeface's lowercase letters (disregarding ascenders and descenders).

10. Tracking/Letter-Spacing:
The uniform amount of spacing between characters in a complete section of text (sentence, line, paragraph, page, etc.).

11. Kerning:
The horizontal spacing between two consecutive characters; adjusting the kerning creates the appearance of uniformity and reduces gaps of white space between certain letter combinations.

12. Leading/Line-Spacing:
The vertical spacing between lines of text (from baseline to baseline).

## The Anatomy of a Letter

13. Stroke:
A single linear element that forms part of a character; may be straight or curved.

14. Stem:
The main (usually vertical) stroke of a letterform.

15. Arc of Stem:
A curved stroke that is continuous with a stem.

16. Foot:
The part of the stem that rests on the baseline.

17. Descender:
A piece of a letter that extends below the baseline.

18. Ascender:
A part of a lowercase letter that rises above the main body of the letter (above the x-height).

19. Joint:
The point where a stroke connects to a stem.

20. Apex:
The uppermost connecting point of a letterform where two strokes meet; may be rounded, sharp/pointed, flat/blunt, etc.

21. Vertex:
The point at the bottom of a character where two strokes meet.

22. Crotch:
The inside angle where two strokes meet.

23. Arm:
A horizontal stroke that does not connect to a stem on one or both ends.

24. Leg:
A short, descending stroke on a letterform.

25. Shoulder:
A curved stroke extending down from a stem.

26. Bar/Crossbar:
A horizontal stroke that is enclosed.

27. Cross Stroke:
A line that extends across/through the stem of a letter.

28. Bowl:
The closed, round or oval curve of a letter.

29. Counter:
An enclosed or partially enclosed area of white space within a letter; could be bounded by curves, strokes, or stems.

30. Aperture:
The opening or partially enclosed negative space created by an open counter.

31. Double-Story:
A type of letter that has two counters (as opposed to the single-story version, which has only one counter).

32. Terminal:
The end of any stroke that doesn't include a serif; includes ball terminals (circular in shape) and finials (curved or tapered in shape).

33. Swash:
A decorative extension or stroke on a letterform; may be part of a letter by design or available either as an additional glyph or as an add-on to the standard character.

34. Ligature:
Two or more letters that are connected to form one character; primarily decorative (the embellishment that connects the two letters is called a "gadzook").
