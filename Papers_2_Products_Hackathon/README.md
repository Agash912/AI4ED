#  "Papers to Products" Hackathon

 "Papers to Products" hackathon [https://papers2products.com/](https://papers2products.com/), facilitated by Northeastern University's DATA Initiative and AI Skunkworks, invites interdisciplinary teams to develop product prototypes based on research from students and faculty. 

 # CHALLENGE

We are excited to announce the hackathon is now open to submissions for product prototypes developed from research conducted by both students and faculty at Northeastern University. Signup as a Team of up to 4 people or individually and we will match you with a Team. Special recognition is given for teams whose members come from multiple home colleges. The more diverse the disciplines of the members the better. There is no reason your prototype can’t win multiple prizes.

To allow for increased interest, the registration deadline for the “Papers2Products” hackathon has been extended to Friday, February 2nd. Later phases of the hackathon have been accordingly updated to reflect this extension and final winners will be announced Wednesday, March 7. You can of course get started early.
