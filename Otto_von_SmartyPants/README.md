# Requirements Document for Otto von SmartyPants and Automated Grading App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for an automated grading application designed to streamline the process of evaluating student assignments. The application will accept a zip file containing student assignments and a rubric in the form of prompt instructions for grading. It will utilize various Large Language Models (LLMs) to grade assignments, allowing for submissions to be evaluated multiple times by each model and across multiple models. The system will then compile these evaluations, average the metrics and scores, and generate both an average score and a confidence level for each assignment.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Interface

1. **Upload Interface:** Users can upload a zip file containing student assignments and a separate document or file containing the grading rubric in the form of prompt instructions.
2. **Model Selection:** Users can select one or more LLMs from a list of available models for evaluating the assignments.
3. **Submission Management:** Users can submit the assignments to be graded multiple times to each selected model.
4. **Results Interface:** Users can view and download detailed feedback, including scores, confidence levels, and combined reports for each student assignment.

### 2.2 Core Features

1. **Assignment Processing:** The app shall extract assignments from the uploaded zip file and process them according to the provided rubric.
2. **Model Integration:** The app shall integrate with various LLMs, allowing for flexible assignment grading based on user-selected models.
3. **Evaluation Repetition:** The app shall support submitting each assignment multiple times to each selected LLM to ensure grading consistency and reliability.
4. **Score Aggregation:** The app shall aggregate scores and metrics from all evaluations, calculating an average score and a confidence level for each assignment.
5. **Report Generation:** The app shall generate detailed reports for each assignment, including individual scores from each LLM, average scores, and confidence levels.

### 2.3 Data Management

1. **Data Storage:** The app shall securely store all uploaded documents, grading results, and generated reports.
2. **Data Privacy:** The app shall comply with data protection regulations, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of student assignments and grading results.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

1. **Response Time:** The app shall process uploads and generate grading results within a reasonable time frame, not exceeding a specified limit for the total number of assignments.
2. **Scalability:** The app shall efficiently handle varying loads, from individual assignments to large batches of submissions.

### 3.2 Usability

1. **Ease of Use:** The app shall offer an intuitive user interface, minimizing the learning curve for new users.
2. **Accessibility:** The app shall comply with accessibility standards, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

### 3.3 Security

1. **Data Security:** The app shall implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information, including student assignments and grading results.
2. **Compliance:** The app shall comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements regarding data protection and privacy.

### 3.4 Reliability

1. **Uptime:** The app shall aim for high availability, with minimal downtime.
2. **Data Integrity:** The app shall ensure the integrity of grading results, with mechanisms in place to detect and correct any errors in the grading process.

## 4. System Requirements

### 4.1 Hardware Requirements

- The app shall be deployable on standard server hardware or cloud platforms, with scalable resources to meet demand.

### 4.2 Software Requirements

- **Backend:** Compatible with major server operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows Server).
- **Frontend:** Accessible through modern web browsers without requiring any specific plugins.
- **APIs:** Integration with LLMs through their respective APIs, requiring internet connectivity.

## 5. Compliance and Standards

- The app shall adhere to GDPR (for European users) and other relevant data protection laws.
- The app shall follow best practices in software development and cybersecurity.

## 6. Quality Assurance

- **Testing:** The app shall undergo thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive user and technical documentation shall be provided.

## 7. Implementation Timeline

- A detailed project timeline, including phases for design, development, testing, and deployment, shall be prepared and followed.

## 8. Maintenance and Support

- The app shall include a plan for ongoing maintenance, updates, and user support.

This document sets the foundation for developing an automated grading application that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to provide efficient, reliable, and scalable assignment grading.
