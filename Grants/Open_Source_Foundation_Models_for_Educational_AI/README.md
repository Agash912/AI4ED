# Open Source Foundation Models for Educational AI

Northeastern University is requesting computing resources to build open-source Foundation Models for Educational AI. The AI Skunkworks initiative exemplifies the university's commitment to leveraging AI in education. With a philosophy of "Learn AI by doing AI," Northeastern engages in real-world, project-based learning to enhance AI tools.

Through its extensive network, including 13 campuses, Northeastern is prepared to make significant contributions to the Foundation Model Development Call for Proposals â€” Winter 2024, enhancing educational dialogue systems, learning platforms, bias detection, content generation efficiency, and multimodal learning experiences.

## Teaching & Learning xAI

The project is transforming teaching and learning methodologies using generative AI, led by Connie Yowell and overseen by David Madigan. It aims to create AI-driven educational approaches that are transparent, reliable, and ethically integrated.

## AI Skunkworks

Led by Nik Bear Brown, AI Skunkworks is a hub for hands-on AI projects, fostering research, creativity, and entrepreneurial skills. It encourages mentorship and collaboration on open-source projects, with a diverse community engaged in AI research and applications.

## AI for Education Project (AI4ED)

AI4ED, part of AI Skunkworks, focuses on making learning adaptive, interactive, and student-centered. It creates open-source tools using AI technologies like LLMs and Generative AI, aiming to bridge the gap between research and practical application.

## Foundation Models for Educational AI Projects

- **Educational Dialogue System**: Using reinforcement learning with human feedback for improved student engagement.
- **Adaptive Learning Platform**: Employing distillation techniques for personalized content.
- **Bias Detection**: Developing models for fair educational AI applications.
- **Content Generation Efficiency**: Enhancing the creation of educational materials.
- **Multimodal Learning Experiences**: Creating FMs for novel educational modalities.
