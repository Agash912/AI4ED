## "Semesterization"

"Semesterization" refers to the academic structuring process where the academic year is divided into semesters, typically two main periods of study within a year, often complemented by shorter terms for accelerated courses or special programs.

Semesterization is part of a broader shift towards modularization in higher education, where courses are broken down into discrete, self-contained units (modules) that can be combined in various ways to meet educational requirements.

### Viewing "Semesterization" as a “Modularization” Problem

Viewing "Semesterization" as a "Modularization" problem involves a strategic approach to curriculum development and course design, focusing on the division of academic content into smaller, more manageable units (modules) that can be recombined in various ways to form comprehensive semester courses. This approach enhances flexibility and adaptability of educational offerings and aligns with the goals of personalized education and skill-based learning.

#### Steps to Implementing Semesterization as Modularization:

1. **Integration of Multiple Ontologies**: Begin by integrating various existing skill mapping ontologies into a unified ontology to cover a comprehensive range of skills and competencies across industries and educational fields.
2. **Identify Essential Skills and Learning Outcomes**: Map quarter courses to essential skills/learning, focusing on core competencies and knowledge areas crucial for student success.
3. **Break Quarter Courses into Learning Modules**: Decompose courses into smaller learning modules, each focusing on a specific skill or knowledge area.
4. **Create Semester Courses Based on Essential Skills/Learning**: Reassemble modules into semester courses, guided by overarching learning objectives to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive learning journey.
5. **Aligning with Degree Program Outcomes**: Ensure semester courses collectively cover the essential skills and learning outcomes expected over a student's degree program.
6. **Continuous Evaluation and Adjustment**: Implement a system for ongoing evaluation and feedback, making necessary adjustments to continuously improve the curriculum.

### Multiple Ontologies:

- **ESCO**: A multilingual classification of European skills, competences, qualifications, and occupations.
- **O*NET**: A comprehensive database of worker attributes and job characteristics developed by the U.S. Department of Labor.
- **SFIA**: Provides a globally recognized framework for IT skills.
- **CaSS**: An open-source framework for documenting, tracking, and sharing competencies, skills, and achievements.
- **ACSF**: Outlines core skills in literacy and numeracy across various levels of performance, used primarily in the Australian vocational education and training sector.
