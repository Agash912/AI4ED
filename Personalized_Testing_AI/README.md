# Personalized Testing AI

**System Requirements Document**

## System Overview

The purpose of this system is to provide educators, particularly professors, with a tool to create personalized test variants for each student in their class. This customization aims to minimize cheating opportunities, cater to individual student learning paths, and ensure a fair assessment environment. The system will leverage generative AI to create these variants based on a master test provided by the professor. It will also incorporate statistical analysis, specifically using the F-Test, to confirm that all test variants are statistically equivalent in terms of difficulty and content coverage.

### Objectives

1. **Personalization**: Generate individualized test variants for each student.
2. **Fairness**: Ensure all test variants are statistically equivalent.
3. **Integrity**: Minimize cheating by providing unique but equivalent tests.
4. **Efficiency**: Streamline the test creation process for educators.
5. **Analysis**: Provide statistical assurance of test equivalence.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Test Template Creation

- **1.1 Input**: Professors should be able to input a master test template, including questions, possible formats, and topics covered.
- **1.2 Question Bank Integration**: The system should have the capability to integrate with existing question banks for additional variability.

### 2. Generative AI Test Variant Creation

- **2.1 AI Model Training**: The AI model must be trained on a diverse set of academic tests and materials to understand various question formats, difficulty levels, and subject matter.
- **2.2 Personalization Algorithm**: Develop an algorithm that adjusts question difficulty, topics, and formats based on the master test to generate personalized variants.
- **2.3 Content Validation**: Ensure that generated questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from biases.

### 3. Statistical Equivalence Testing

- **3.1 F-Test Implementation**: Implement an F-Test or similar statistical tests to compare variances among test scores to ensure all variants are equivalent in difficulty.
- **3.2 Analytics Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard to display the statistical analysis results, including F-Test scores, to professors for review.

### 4. Test Distribution and Management

- **4.1 Secure Distribution**: Ensure secure and confidential distribution of test variants to students.
- **4.2 Test Version Tracking**: Track which test variant is assigned to each student to manage grading and analysis.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability

- The system interface should be intuitive for professors to input master tests and review statistical analyses.
- Provide training materials or tutorials for new users.

### 2. Scalability

- The system must be scalable to accommodate classes of varying sizes, from small seminars to large lectures.
- It should handle the generation and analysis of hundreds of test variants simultaneously.

### 3. Performance

- Test generation and statistical analysis should be completed within a reasonable time frame, not exceeding a few minutes for an average-sized class.
- The system should ensure high uptime, especially during critical testing periods.

### 4. Security

- Implement robust security measures to protect the integrity of test questions and student information.
- Ensure compliance with educational privacy laws and regulations, such as FERPA in the United States.

### 5. Accessibility

- Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Q1-Q2)**: System design, AI model training, and initial development.
- **Phase 2 (Q3)**: Beta testing with a select group of educators and courses.
- **Phase 3 (Q4)**: Full implementation, including training and support materials for wider use.

## Approval and Amendments

This document is subject to review and approval by the project stakeholders. Any amendments must be documented and approved in subsequent versions of the document.
