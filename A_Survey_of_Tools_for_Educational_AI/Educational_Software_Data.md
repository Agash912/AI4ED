# Educational Software (An Awesome List)

## LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) like the GPT Series (OpenAI), LLaMA (Facebook AI), Gemini (Google), and others are a way of interacting with computers using natural language instead of traditional programming languages like C++, SQL or python.

LLMs are revolutionizing our interaction with computers by facilitating natural language communication. Here's a consolidated list of some top LLMs, including their unique strengths, particularly suited for developing educational software:

1. **GPT-3 by OpenAI**: Renowned for its broad natural language understanding and generation capabilities, making it highly versatile for chatbot development.
2. **GPT-4 by OpenAI**: This iteration introduces advanced features and improved contextual understanding over its predecessor.
3. **LLaMA by Facebook AI**: Provides multiple model sizes, allowing developers to find the right balance between performance and resource usage for chatbot applications.
4. **Gemini by Google**: Google's contribution to LLMs, focusing on enhancing conversation and contextual comprehension.
5. **BERT by Google**: Specializes in understanding the context of words in search queries through deep learning techniques.
6. **RoBERTa by Facebook AI**: An optimized version of BERT, pre-trained on an even larger dataset for robust performance.
7. **T5 by Google**: The Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer reformulates all NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text problem format.
8. **XLNet by Google/CMU**: Surpasses BERT on various benchmarks with its permutation-based training approach.
9. **Megatron-Turing NLG by NVIDIA and Microsoft**: Stands out as one of the largest transformer-based language models available, offering significant power for complex chatbot tasks.
10. **Jurassic-1 by AI21 Labs**: Aimed at developing a deeper contextual understanding, thereby enhancing chatbot interactions.
11. **DeBERTa by Microsoft**: Improves upon BERT and RoBERTa models with a disentangled attention mechanism for more nuanced language understanding.

Additionally, the chatbot development landscape is further enriched by models such as:

- **ChatGPT** by OpenAI: Specifically designed for engaging in natural language conversations, often updated with new capabilities like plugins for broader use cases.
- **LLaMA 2** by Meta AI: Notable for its code understanding and completion, suitable for both research and commercial use, especially for chatbot development.
- **FALCON** by the Technology Innovation Institute: Offers high-quality model variants for self-hosting, ideal when computational resources are not a constraint.
- **Mistral 7B** by Mistral AI: Excels in benchmarks against other models, offering a balance between size and performance for efficient chatbot deployment.
- **BLOOM** by BigScience: A multilingual LLM generating text in numerous natural and programming languages, aimed at transparent and interpretable model development.
- **LaMDA** by Google: Focuses on generating natural and engaging user conversations, trained on dialogue to grasp conversational nuances.

These models are paving the way for AI-driven chatbot development, each offering distinctive features that cater to nuanced and sophisticated interaction capabilities.



## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is both an art and a science of crafting language inputs (prompts) that elicit the best, most accurate, or most useful responses from Large Language Models (LLMs).

### How SmartyBots Helps Prompt Engineering:

SmartyBots provides resources and chatbots for educators to learn and apply prompt engineering effectively. Through examples, tailored bots, and dedicated learning materials, users can craft prompts to elicit desired responses from LLMs, enhancing educational content.

## Bots and the “Bot Garden”

A bot or an "agent" refers to a program or entity that acts autonomously or semi-autonomously to perform tasks or achieve goals set by its design such as creating a quiz or providing feedback on writing.

### How SmartyBots Helps Create Task-Specific Bots:

SmartyBots offers a vast collection of task-specific bots designed for educational purposes. Educators can mix and match bots to create customized educational mentors. For instance, a generic quiz bot can be transformed into a subject-specific tutor, such as for math or art, guided by faculty expertise.

## AI Task Routing

"Router bots" or "orchestration layers" in AI systems serve to control the flow of tasks within an application, deciding which task-specific bot or service to hand a task to based on the context or the content of the request. If the context is unclear the bot is instructed to ask clarifying questions.

### How SmartyBots Helps Task Routing:

Within the 'bot garden', SmartyBots includes router bots that act as an orchestration layer. These bots intelligently direct queries to the appropriate task-specific bot, ensuring students' inquiries are handled by the best-suited educational bot.

## Vector Databases - External Data for LLMs

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store, manage, and index high-dimensional unstructured data efficiently. They enable fast and efficient similarity searches and are crucial for LLMs and generative AI applications.

### How SmartyBots Helps the use of Vector Databases:

SmartyBots provides tools for the secure encryption and storage of unstructured data. This enhances LLMs' performance by facilitating fast and efficient similarity searches without compromising data privacy.

## Langchain, and Langflow

LangChain is a framework designed to facilitate the development of applications powered by LLMs. It includes products like LangSmith for improving the quality of LLM-powered apps and LangServe for deploying APIs.

LangFlow is a GUI for LangChain that facilitates easy prototyping of LangChain flows. It is Python-native and emphasizes ease of use, with a focus on no-code AI ecosystem integration.

### How SmartyBots Helps Langchain, and Langflow:

SmartyBots integrates with LangChain and LangFlow, offering educators the ability to develop context-aware and reasoning applications powered by LLMs.

## No Code Chatbot Bot Creation

Chatbots in the Smartpants ecosystem allow educators to create other chatbots by having a conversation with a chatbot.

### How SmartyBots Helps No Code Chatbot Bot Creation:

SmartyBots enables educators to create specialized chatbots through conversation, specifying functions, knowledge base, and interaction style without coding.

## Fine-Tuning Custom LLMs

Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained LLM to enhance its performance for specific tasks by training it on a targeted dataset.

### How SmartyBots Helps Fine-Tuning Custom LLMs:

SmartyBots provides tools and code to extend existing LLMs with private data and deploy them within its ecosystem.

## Cloud and Interface Agnosticism

SmartyBots interfaces with major cloud platforms and services like Slack, Discord, Teams, and Canvas.

## Summary

SmartyBots democratizes the use of AI in education, enhancing learning experiences through personalized support and innovative teaching methods.
